# Salesforce Demo Project

TODO: Apply sorting to all pages, not just current page
TODO: Fix page size switcher


Create a page/application that lists standard or custom objects (you can choose what object to list)

The list can have several column headers (name, created date, etc, of your choice)

The list can be sortable by any of these column headers (e.g. sort by created date)

Bonus: Add visual indication (e.g. ▲ or ▼) on clicked column to display sorting direction

Clicking on the same column header repeatedly will reverse the order of sorting

The list is paginated; users can cycle between X number of rows by using custom links or buttons. First, Last, Previous, and Next pagination actions are required, and their corresponding custom button/link should be enabled only if action can be performed.

Bonus: Display current page number and total pages.

The list is interactive: the user can perform an action on each row of the list (click a button or select a checkbox on each row); a separate action button will perform some action on each of the selected rows.
